Mobile Barber Shop:  Develop an app that allows you to schedule appointments where a barber will arrive to your house to give you a haircut as opposed to going into a barber shop.  The app will work as almost a "barber sharing" platform, where barbers that are off shift can signup when they have time and then subsequebtly get matched up with customers. 


This product is unique becuase it provides a different platform for barbers to interact with customers.  Instead of being in a physical barbershop, they interact with customers and make profits using the app.  Customers on the other hand, receive unique service in the comfort of our own home.  

A mobile barbershop has been done before, but it has yet to take off into the mainstream.

A customer wants a haircut and goes onto the app to schedule an appontment.  He/She picks a time and date that works for them, and then the app matches them up with a barber that can accomodate the appointment.  Customers can also add their favorite barbers to their network, and schedule their appointments around when they are available.

The end-user data is for the creators of the mobile barbershop business strategy.
