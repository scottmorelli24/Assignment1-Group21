Selling Exotic Pets & Life Insurance

What makes my idea unique because we sell untrained chimpanzees, crocodiles, pythons, large cats, rodents of unusual size and many more dangerous animals. We also sell life insurance.

Selling Exotic pets is not a new idea, neither is selling life insurance; but selling them in the same building, in a package really speaks to millennials desire to die while making sure their family is taken care of. Also, they get cool pets. Our pets will be untrained, of dubious legality, and highly aggressive.

A typical business interaction would be a 20-something Millennial using their parents’ trust fund to buy both the animal and the life insurance. They are usually unable to find work anywhere but a Starbucks. They are attracted to the animals because they are desperately seeking identity and will want something cool to post on Instagram, or Visco if they’re extra. Then they see the deal we’re selling on life insurance and sign up, not knowing that if their death occurs at the hands of the animal we sold them we inherit their measly possessions.
